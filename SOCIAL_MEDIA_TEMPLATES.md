🛡️ Excited to share my latest project: E-Commerce Security & Compliance Dashboard

As someone passionate about Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), I wanted to move beyond theoretical knowledge and build something that demonstrates practical implementation of security and compliance frameworks.

This full-stack platform bridges the gap between technical security and business compliance requirements.

🔍 What it does:
• Scans live websites for security vulnerabilities in real-time
• Automatically calculates compliance scores against ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, GDPR, and OWASP Top 10
• Generates 4 types of professional reports for different stakeholders (Executive, Technical, Compliance, Vulnerability)
• Provides risk visualization through interactive dashboards
• Uses CVSS scoring for standardized risk assessment

💼 GRC Skills Demonstrated:
✅ Regulatory framework implementation (not just theory)
✅ Risk assessment and quantification
✅ Security control validation
✅ Compliance gap analysis
✅ Stakeholder communication (technical → business language)
✅ Process automation for continuous monitoring

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
Security: Real HTTP/HTTPS scanning, CVSS scoring, CWE mapping

📊 The Dashboard Features:
• Real-time vulnerability detection on live e-commerce sites
• Multi-framework compliance tracking with visual indicators
• Automated reporting for management, security teams, and auditors
• Color-coded risk levels for quick decision-making

This project represents my approach to GRC: understanding both the technical controls AND the business compliance requirements they support.

⚡ Just shipped: A full-stack security assessment platform that actually works

Not a mock-up. Real vulnerability scanning. Real compliance scoring.

🔍 The Problem:
E-commerce platforms need continuous security monitoring and compliance validation, but many organizations lack automated tools for this.

💡 The Solution:
Built a dashboard that:
• Scans live websites (Amazon, Google, etc.) for real vulnerabilities
• Detects missing security headers, SSL/TLS issues, injection vulnerabilities
• Calculates compliance against ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, GDPR, OWASP Top 10
• Generates stakeholder-ready reports (Executive, Technical, Compliance, Vulnerability)

🎯 Technical Highlights:
• Real HTTP/HTTPS requests using Node.js native modules
• CVSS 3.1 scoring implementation
• CWE and OWASP Top 10 mapping
• PostgreSQL database with 11 normalized tables
• React 18 + TypeScript frontend with custom Tailwind components
• Professional gradient-based UI design

📊 What I Learned:
• Implementing compliance frameworks in code (ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, etc.)
• Vulnerability detection algorithms
• Risk scoring methodologies (CVSS)
• Security header analysis (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
• Building tools for non-technical stakeholders

This project combines my passion for security and my desire to work in GRC roles—showing that I can both understand technical security controls AND translate them into business compliance language.

🤔 "How do you prove you understand compliance frameworks?"

That question kept me up at night as I applied for GRC roles.

Everyone talks about ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, and GDPR theoretically. I wanted to demonstrate something different: practical implementation.

So I built a full-stack E-Commerce Security & Compliance Dashboard.

📖 Here's what happened:

WEEK 1: Research
→ Studied OWASP Top 10, ISO 27001 controls, PCI-DSS requirements
→ Identified gap between security tools and business compliance needs

WEEK 2-3: Backend Development
→ Built real security scanning engine (not mock data)
→ Implemented CVSS scoring, CWE mapping
→ Created PostgreSQL schema for vulnerability tracking

WEEK 4: Compliance Logic
→ Automated compliance scoring algorithms
→ Mapped vulnerabilities to framework requirements
→ Built gap analysis functionality

WEEK 5: Reporting & UI
→ Generated 4 report types for different stakeholders
→ Created modern dashboard with Tailwind CSS
→ Added interactive charts and visualizations

RESULT:
✅ Scans real websites (Amazon, Google, Mercari, etc.)
✅ Detects actual vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)
✅ Calculates compliance scores for ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, GDPR, OWASP
✅ Produces professional reports for C-suite, security teams, and auditors
✅ Production-ready codebase with clean architecture

🎯 What This Proves:
• I don't just understand frameworks—I can build systems that enforce them
• I can translate technical security into business compliance language
• I can automate GRC processes
• I can create tools that multiple stakeholders can use

💼 Skills Demonstrated:
Risk Assessment | Compliance Management | Security Controls | Stakeholder Communication | Process Automation | Technical Security | Full-Stack Development

### Tweet 1 (Main)
```
🛡️ Just launched: E-Commerce Security & Compliance Dashboard

Real vulnerability scanning + Multi-framework compliance (ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, GDPR, OWASP) + Professional reporting

Perfect for GRC professionals who want to see compliance frameworks in action 🔒

🎥 Demo: [link]
💻 Code: [link]

🧵 Thread on what makes this different ↓
```

### Tweet 2
```
2/ Most security tools focus on EITHER technical scanning OR compliance reporting.

This does both.

Why? Because in real GRC roles, you need to understand how technical controls map to compliance requirements.

Example: Missing HSTS header → ISO 27001 failure → business risk
```

### Tweet 3
```
3/ The scanning is REAL:

• Scans live websites (Amazon, Google, etc.)
• Detects missing security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
• Finds SQL injection vulnerabilities
• Checks cookie security
• Validates SSL/TLS config

Not mock data. Actual HTTP requests. 🔍
```

### Tweet 4
```
4/ Compliance scoring is automated:

Each vulnerability found → CVSS score → CWE category → OWASP mapping → Framework impact

Result: 0-100% compliance score for:
• ISO 27001
• PCI-DSS
• GDPR
• OWASP Top 10

Automatic gap analysis ✅
```

### Tweet 5
```
5/ Reports for different audiences:

📊 Executive Summary → C-suite
🔧 Technical Report → Security teams
✅ Compliance Report → Auditors
⚠️ Vulnerability Report → DevOps

Because GRC is about communication, not just finding issues.
```

### Tweet 6
```
6/ Built with:

Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: PostgreSQL 15

Modern gradient UI, interactive charts, professional polish.

Because your portfolio should look as good as it functions 🎨
```

### Tweet 7
```
7/ What I learned building this:

• How to implement ISO 27001 controls in code
• CVSS scoring methodology
• Vulnerability detection algorithms
• Risk communication for non-technical stakeholders
• Full-stack development with security focus

Skills that matter in GRC roles 💪
```

### Tweet 8 (CTA)

8/ Why I built this:

To prove I don't just understand compliance frameworks theoretically—I can build systems that enforce and monitor them.
