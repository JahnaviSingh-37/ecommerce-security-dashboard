## 📋 Video Script & Structure

### Introduction (30 seconds)

**[Show Dashboard Homepage]**

Hi, I'm Jahnavi Singh, and I'm excited to walk you through my E-Commerce Security & Compliance Dashboard—a project I built to demonstrate my understanding of Governance, Risk, and Compliance principles.

This isn't just a theoretical exercise. It's a fully functional security assessment platform that scans real websites, identifies vulnerabilities, calculates compliance scores against industry frameworks, and generates professional reports for stakeholders.

Let me show you how it works.

---

### Section 1: Real-Time Security Scanning (1 minute)

**[Navigate to Scans Page]**

The heart of this dashboard is the security scanning engine. Let me demonstrate by scanning a real e-commerce website.

**[Enter URL: https://www.amazon.com]**

I'll select "Full Security Scan" which checks for:
- Missing security headers like HSTS and Content Security Policy
- SSL/TLS configuration
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) weaknesses
- CSRF protection
- Cookie security settings
- And specific payment security checks for PCI-DSS compliance

**[Click "Start Scan"]**

The scan runs in real-time, making actual HTTP requests to analyze the target website's security posture.

**[Wait for scan to complete, show results]**

And here are the results. The scan found [X] vulnerabilities, automatically classified by severity—Critical, High, Medium, and Low—using CVSS scoring methodology.

---

### Section 2: Risk Management & Vulnerability Analysis (1 minute)

**[Navigate to Vulnerabilities Page]**

In the Vulnerabilities page, we can see detailed information about each finding. Notice how each vulnerability includes:
- A severity rating with color coding for quick risk assessment
- CVSS scores for industry-standard risk quantification  
- CWE IDs for vulnerability classification
- OWASP Top 10 category mapping
- And current remediation status

**[Click on a vulnerability to show details]**

This level of detail helps security teams prioritize remediation efforts based on business risk—a key component of effective risk management.

---

### Section 3: Compliance Frameworks (1 minute)

**[Navigate to Compliance Page]**

Now, this is where the GRC focus really comes through. The Compliance page automatically calculates scores against four major frameworks:

**[Point to each framework]**

1. **ISO 27001** - Information Security Management
2. **PCI-DSS** - Payment Card Industry standards
3. **GDPR** - Data protection regulations
4. **OWASP Top 10** - Web application security

Each score is calculated based on the vulnerabilities found during scanning. Notice how each framework is labeled with which specific scan it came from—this provides full traceability for audit purposes.

**[Scroll through compliance cards]**

The color-coded progress bars make it easy to see at a glance where we're compliant and where we need improvement. This is exactly the kind of dashboard a GRC professional needs to track organizational compliance posture.

---

### Section 4: Professional Reporting (1 minute)

**[Navigate to Reports Page]**

One of the most important GRC skills is communicating security findings to different audiences. That's why I built four types of professional reports:

**[Point to each button]**

1. **Executive Summary** - High-level overview for C-suite and board members
2. **Technical Report** - Detailed analysis for security teams with remediation steps
3. **Compliance Report** - Framework-specific checklists for auditors
4. **Vulnerability Report** - Complete findings list with priority levels

**[Download one report, open it]**

Each report is professionally formatted and download-ready. Here's an example of the Compliance Report—notice how it includes OWASP Top 10 checklists, PCI-DSS requirements, and specific compliance gaps.

This demonstrates that I understand different stakeholders need different information, and I can translate technical findings into business language.

---

### Section 5: Dashboard Analytics (30 seconds)

**[Navigate back to Dashboard]**

Finally, the main dashboard provides real-time metrics and visualizations:

**[Point to stat cards]**
- Total vulnerabilities found
- Overall security score
- Compliance percentage
- Number of scans performed

**[Point to charts]**

The pie chart shows vulnerability distribution by severity, and the bar chart tracks compliance across all four frameworks. These visualizations help leadership understand security posture at a glance.

---

### Closing (30 seconds)

**[Show Dashboard overview]**

So that's my E-Commerce Security & Compliance Dashboard. This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Implement technical security controls
- Understand and apply compliance frameworks
- Assess and quantify business risk
- Automate GRC processes
- Communicate effectively with different stakeholders

If you're looking for someone who can bridge the gap between technical security and business compliance, I'd love to discuss how I can contribute to your team.
